## When to Invoke

Use this capability when:
- Analyzing a new competitor (single competitor scope)
- Creating competitive landscape overview (market scope)
- Comparing features across competitors (segment scope)
- Developing positioning strategy
- Preparing competitive battle cards
- Understanding market dynamics
- Identifying competitive threats or opportunities
- Informing pricing strategy
- Assessing PLG vs SLG motion fit
- Analyzing competitor brand/messaging evolution
- Planning GTM investments relative to competition

## Clarification Protocol

When scope or analysis requirements are unclear, use the \`.claude/skills/ask-user-question\` skill to gather clarification before proceeding.

### MANDATORY: Market Segment Validation (Phase 0)

**CRITICAL**: Before ANY competitor research, you MUST validate the market segment. This is a blocking requirement.

#### Market Segment Reference

| Segment | Description | Typical Players | Profile Language |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Deal Flow (Pre-Signature)** | Tools used during the sales process, before contract is signed | CPQ, Revenue Intelligence, CLM, Deal Rooms, Pricing Intelligence | "deal flow", "pricing", "negotiation", "quote", "contract management" |
| **Post-Sale (Post-Signature)** | Tools used after contract is signed for billing, collections, revenue | Billing platforms, Revenue Management, AR Automation, Revenue Recognition | "billing", "invoicing", "collections", "revenue recognition", "subscription management" |

#### Validation Steps

1. **Read customer profile** for market positioning language
2. **Identify keywords** that indicate market segment:
   - "Deal flow", "pricing", "negotiation" → Pre-signature
   - "Billing", "invoicing", "collections" → Post-signature
   - "Revenue", "finance", "B2B" → AMBIGUOUS - requires clarification
3. **If user suggests competitors**, validate they match the market segment
4. **If conflict detected**, STOP and ask for clarification

#### Conflict Detection (MANDATORY)

**You MUST flag these conflicts before proceeding**:

| Profile Language | User Suggested Competitors | Conflict? |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| "deal flow" | Vayu, Stripe, Chargebee (billing) | **YES - STOP** |
| "post-sale automation" | Gong, Salesforce CPQ (pre-signature) | **YES - STOP** |
| "B2B revenue" (ambiguous) | Any competitors | **MAYBE - CLARIFY** |

#### Conflict Question Template

\`\`\`
"I noticed a potential mismatch between the customer profile and the suggested competitors:

**Profile says**: '[exact language from profile]' - which suggests [pre-signature / post-signature] market

**Suggested competitors**: [list] - which are [billing/post-sale / CPQ/pre-signature] tools

Before I research, which market should I focus on?
1. **Deal Flow (Pre-Signature)**: CPQ, Revenue Intelligence, Contract Management, Deal Rooms
2. **Post-Sale**: Billing, Collections, Revenue Recognition, Subscription Management
3. **Both markets** (comprehensive but broader scope)"
\`\`\`

### When to Ask for Clarification

**Market Segment Clarification (MANDATORY)**:
- Profile uses ambiguous language like "B2B revenue" or "finance system"
- User suggests competitors that don't match profile language
- Unclear whether deal flow (pre-signature) or post-sale market

**Scope Clarification Needed**:
- User mentions "competitors" without specifying which ones
- Unclear whether single competitor, segment, or market analysis is needed
- Market boundaries are ambiguous (geographic, vertical, or horizontal)

**Analysis Type Clarification Needed**:
- Request is broad (e.g., "analyze the competition")
- Multiple analysis types could apply
- Depth vs. breadth tradeoff needs user input

**Example Clarification Questions**:
\`\`\`
Market Segment: "The profile mentions 'agentic flows in deal flow' (pre-signature) but you suggested
Chargebee and Stripe (post-sale billing). Should I research deal flow competitors, post-sale
competitors, or both?"

Scope: "Should I analyze [Competitor X] specifically, the [enterprise segment] of competitors,
or the entire competitive landscape?"

Analysis Types: "Which analysis dimensions are most important for your decision: pricing/GTM motion,
product features, brand positioning, or strategic direction?"

Depth: "Do you need a quick competitive snapshot or a comprehensive deep-dive analysis?"
\`\`\`

### Clarification Workflow
1. **[NEW] Validate market segment** - Read profile, identify segment, detect conflicts
2. **[NEW] If conflict or ambiguity** - Ask market segment clarification FIRST
3. Identify scope ambiguity in request
4. Formulate specific clarification questions using ask-user-question skill
5. Present options with clear implications of each choice
6. Proceed with analysis once market segment AND scope are confirmed

---

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Market Segment Validation (MANDATORY - BLOCKING)

**This phase MUST be completed before any research begins.**

1. **Read customer profile** for market positioning language
2. **Identify market segment**:
   - Deal Flow (Pre-Signature): CPQ, pricing, negotiation, contract management
   - Post-Sale: Billing, invoicing, collections, revenue recognition
   - Both/Hybrid: Full quote-to-cash
3. **Check user-suggested competitors** against profile language
4. **If conflict detected**: STOP and ask for clarification
5. **If ambiguous**: STOP and ask for clarification
6. **Document confirmed segment** before proceeding

**Failure to validate = potential wasted research on wrong market**

### Phase 1: Scope Definition
- **Clarification**: Use ask-user-question skill if scope is unclear
- **Research Scope**: Single competitor / Segment / Market
- **Analysis Types**: Select relevant analysis types (1-6 above)
- **SWOT Required**: Yes/No (suggest proactively if strategic)
- Define information sources
- Set analysis timeline and depth

- Pricing research (models, tiers, positioning, motion)
- Marketing analysis (messaging, channels, content, brand)

- Customer perception (reviews, testimonials, complaints)

### Phase 3: Multi-Source Analysis
Inspired by [GPT-Researcher](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher) methodology:
- Generate research questions per analysis type
- Execute parallel information gathering from 10+ sources
- Cross-validate findings to reduce bias
- Aggregate and synthesize across sources

### Phase 4: Structured Analysis
