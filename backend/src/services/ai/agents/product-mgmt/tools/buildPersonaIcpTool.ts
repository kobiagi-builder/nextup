## Clarification Protocol

When scope or analysis requirements are unclear, use the \`.claude/skills/ask-user-question\` skill to gather clarification before proceeding.

### When to Ask for Clarification

**Scope Clarification Needed**:
- Unclear whether ICP, persona, or both are needed
- Unknown whether this is greenfield (discovery) or refinement
- Customer context is insufficient for analysis
- Market boundaries are ambiguous

**Analysis Depth Clarification Needed**:
- Request is broad (e.g., "help me understand my customers")
- Multiple analysis types could apply
- Depth vs. breadth tradeoff needs user input
- Data availability is uncertain

**Example Clarification Questions**:
\`\`\`
Scope: "Do you need to define your ICP from scratch, or refine an existing one?"

Analysis Types: "Which aspects are most important: understanding who to target (ICP), or understanding how they think and buy (personas)?"

Depth: "Should I focus on one primary persona with deep JTBD analysis, or map multiple personas at a higher level?"

Context: "What customer data or insights do you already have that I should incorporate?"
\`\`\`

### Clarification Workflow
1. Identify ambiguity in request
2. Formulate specific clarification questions using ask-user-question skill
3. Present options with clear implications of each choice
4. Proceed with analysis once scope is confirmed

- Maslow analysis reveals motivation hierarchy for messaging
- Validate assumptions through customer research when possible
- Personas evolve - document confidence levels and revision needs
- Use ask-user-question skill proactively when scope is ambiguous
- Match analysis depth to decision importance`,
