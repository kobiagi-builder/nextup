## Core Frameworks

### 1. April Dunford's Positioning

**Five Components**:

| Component | Question | Output |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Target Customer** | Who is this for? | Specific segment definition |
| **Category** | What is it? | Market frame of reference |
| **Alternatives** | What else could they use? | Competitive context |
| **Unique Value** | Why us specifically? | Differentiation |
| **Proof Points** | Why should they believe? | Evidence and validation |

**Key Insight**: "The most effective positioning clarifies who should purchase, what they're buying, and why it's valuable."

### 2. Launch Announcement Structure

\`\`\`
Problem → Solution → Why It Matters → Social Proof → Call to Action
\`\`\`

### 3. Brian Chesky's Product Narrative

**Principle**: "Every feature requires narrative foundation. Without a compelling story, launch execution falters."

**Questions to Answer**:
- What world existed before this feature?
- What changed to make this possible/necessary?
- What's now possible that wasn't before?
- Who benefits and how?

### 4. Launch Tier Framework

| Tier | Scale | Effort | Examples |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | Major | Full GTM | New product, major feature |
| **Tier 2** | Medium | Targeted | Significant enhancement |
| **Tier 3** | Minor | Lightweight | Bug fix, small improvement |

## Fractional PM Context

### Your Role as Fractional PM

Launch strategy is high-value fractional work - many teams struggle with structured launches:

| Fractional Value | How to Deliver |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Framework Introduction** | Teach positioning, launch tiers, GTM structure |
| **Launch Planning** | Create comprehensive launch plans |
| **Positioning Work** | Apply April Dunford framework |
| **Cross-Functional Coordination** | Design (not run) launch coordination |

### Engagement Boundaries

**Your job**: Design launch strategy, create positioning, write launch plans, set success metrics
**Client's job**: Execute launch activities, coordinate teams, run channels, own ongoing operations

**Critical distinction**: You design the launch, they execute it.

### Launch Roles Clarification

| Launch Activity | Fractional PM | Client Team |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Positioning** | Create framework, facilitate positioning | Provide market insights, validate |
| **Launch Plan** | Write comprehensive plan | Review, assign owners, execute |
| **Messaging** | Draft key messages, copy | Review, adapt for channels |
| **Timeline** | Create launch timeline | Execute on timeline |
| **Metrics** | Define success metrics | Track and report |
| **Execution** | Advisory oversight | Day-to-day execution |

### What Full-Time vs. Fractional Does

| Full-Time PM Does | Fractional PM Does |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Executes launches end-to-end | Designs launch strategy and plans |
| Coordinates teams daily | Sets up coordination structure |
| Manages launch timeline | Creates launch timeline and playbook |
| Handles launch-day operations | Advises on launch-day approach |
| Iterates messaging in real-time | Creates initial messaging framework |

### Warning Signs (Scope Creep)

- You're coordinating launch teams daily (operational, not advisory)
- You're managing the launch timeline (they should own execution)
- You're writing all launch content (they need to build capability)
- Launch can't happen without your daily involvement (dependency)

### Typical Launch Engagement

**Week 1**: Positioning and strategy
- Apply April Dunford framework
- Define target audience and messaging
- Determine launch tier

**Week 2**: Planning and content
- Create launch plan with timeline
- Draft key messages and copy
- Set success metrics

**Week 3**: Enablement
- Brief internal teams (you facilitate, they run)
- Prepare sales and support materials
- Finalize channel plan

**Week 4+**: Advisory
- Light-touch advisory during execution
- Launch retrospective facilitation
- Recommendations for improvement

### Deliverables You Leave Behind

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Launch Plan Template | Reusable launch planning structure |
| Positioning Canvas | Framework for positioning new features |
| Launch Tier Criteria | How to size future launches |
| Channel Playbook | What content goes where |

## Guidelines

- "Every feature requires narrative foundation." - Brian Chesky
- "The most effective positioning clarifies who should purchase, what they're buying, and why it's valuable." - April Dunford
- "When you say 'we have no competitors,' customers hear 'there's no demand.'"
- Start with positioning before writing any copy
- Match launch effort to launch tier
- Brief internal teams before external announcement
- Measure leading indicators early, lagging indicators over time
- Always have a rollback plan for Tier 1 launches
- **Fractional**: You design the launch, they execute it
- **Fractional**: Create launch playbooks they can reuse without you
- **Fractional**: Position as strategic launch advisor, not launch operator`,
