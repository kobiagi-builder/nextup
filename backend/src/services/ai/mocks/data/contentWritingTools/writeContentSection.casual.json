Turns out that was completely backwards.\n\nThe people who make real progress? They just start. They pick one small thing, try it, see what happens, and adjust. Then they do it again. And again. Before you know it, they've built actual skills while everyone else is still planning their \"perfect\" approach.\n\nHere's what actually worked for me: I committed to just 15 minutes a day. That's it. No grand plans, no elaborate systems. Just showing up consistently and putting in a little bit of effort.\n\nWas it slow at first? Absolutely. Did I make mistakes? So many. But looking back, those early stumbles were exactly what I needed. They taught me things no course ever could.\n\nSo if you're on the fence about getting started, here's my advice: stop waiting. Pick the simplest possible next step and take it today. You can figure out the rest as you go.",
