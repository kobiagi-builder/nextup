I asked a number of AI researchers (agents) to conduct research on the types of content that get engagement and likes online. The results really surprised me because it feels like a "lower" type of content gets more exposure, likes, and engagement, while "higher" content with a lot of personal or technical professional value will usually get less exposure, less engagement, and fewer likes.

It really bothered me. Are we in a place where "shallow" content is worth more than "high-quality" content? In examples, you can see posts with explicit content, ridicule of political figures (as of Israel and abroad), and even within the categories of "professional" posts - you can see that what is more "shallow" gets more. It's sad to me. Instead of high-quality content that really provides value appearing as high as possible and getting as much engagement as possible, it seems that the desire to get people addicted to "brain rot" outweighs everything.

In short, the researchers started comparing me to others, asking if I wanted a growth plan and saying I needed to be shallower. And then came the stage where I asked: How did you compare me to others? On what basis? And what is relevant in comparing myself to others? And as for likes - why is it important? What difference does it make if I got 1000 likes or 10 likes? For me, the test is a value that I give, which is not necessarily measured by a like or a comment, but by how much real value they received from me.

The bottom line, and after many discussions, Claude said two sentences that I really liked and therefore also shares:

1. Impact is measured by the value we generate, and value is not measured by likes. It is measured by the number of people who suddenly meet and tell how many posts from a year ago happened to change their entire career, or who suddenly receive messages with links to products developed inspired by our content, and so on. It's much more meaningful than being "just a character who gets likes"

2. The core of everything is the comparison to the other. It's just irrelevant to compare me to others. The relevance in comparison, and the only one! - It is to compare my progress between who I am today and who I was yesterday. Not for anyone else. Everyone has his/her journey. And no one is like the other.

I think that if we take these two principles with us – remove envy and hatred and competition from ourselves, and give space for the blessing of Heaven to serve in our own hands, and succeed in praising others with a good eye, because we do not compete, and with a good eye – he will be blessed.

P.S. - I apologize to my community members, before Saturday I released an update that caused Logan to get stuck in a loop during Shabbat and flood with messages. I fixed the problem, it was a logic problem in the feature that automatically shuts down the teams on Saturday. Thank you for the inclusion of the event.
